## Movie Trailer Version 1.0 9/7/2017

### Project Overview

Server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. It will generate a static web page which allows visitors to browse the movies and watch the trailers.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

I use Python 2.7 for my programming, so you'll at least need that. You can download here:  https://www.python.org/downloads/

#### Deployment
The source code files needed for this program to runn will need to be cloned from Github (dvanetten03/udacity-movie-trailer
) or downloaded and kept in the same directory to ensure the code runs correctly.

    * Open Terminal on a Mac (or Command Prompt on Windows)
    * Navigate to directory where files were extracted
    * Type `python entertainment_center.py`

This should open a separate browser window with the movies where you can click on the movie to view the trailer.
